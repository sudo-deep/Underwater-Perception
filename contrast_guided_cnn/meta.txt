EXPERIMENT:

UAENet CNN
LOSS FUNCTIONS: Exposure loss with CCI, TVD LOSS

weights = {
    'Luac': 1.0,    # Weight for underwater color adaptive correction loss
    'Lexp': 0.5,    # Weight for exposure control loss
    'Ltvd': 0.8,    # Weight for illumination smoothness loss
    'Lspa': 0.3     # Weight for spatial consistency loss
}

RESULTS: need smoothness, requires Tvd loss function next

Remarks: loss has reduced greatly, pretty good in those terms.
